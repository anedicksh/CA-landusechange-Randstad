# Cellular Automata for modelling Land use change in Randstad over the years

This project consists of comparing current approaches to model land use change over the years. Cellular Automata has been proved to be an outstanding method in predicting future 
land use change through spatial simulation and modelling process. Therefore, in order to address the research question, three CA models are proposed to simulate the growth of 
residential areas in Randstad since the year 2000. All the code is implemented with Python. PCRaster is used as the software for modelling geospatial data.
